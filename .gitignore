# Files taht should be ignored by git
# This will not be tracked by git or sent to Github

# and omitting the leading / character indicates that the entry is a file.

# For example, 
#
# /Manifest.toml would ignore any file named Manifest.toml
# in the root or any subdirectory of the project.

# Manifest.toml would only ignore a file named Manifest.toml 
# in the root directory of the project.
