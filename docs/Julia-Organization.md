# Julia Organization

## Packages

A package is a collection of related modules and functions, 
which are organized into files and directories. 
Packages are the primary way of organizing and distributing Julia code, 
and are often published on the Julia registry or on other repositories such as GitHub.

## Package Has 1 Top Level Module

Each package typically has a single top-level module with the same name as the package. 
This module defines the public API of the package, 
and its exported functions and variables are the ones intended to be used by other code. 
The module can be defined in a file with the same name as the module, 
or in a file with a different name.

## Other Package Modules

Within a package, there can be many other modules, 
which define submodules of the package. 
Each module can be defined in its own file or 
in the same file as the top-level module. 
Modules are used to organize related code and to 
control the scope of variables and functions.

## Standalone Files and Scripts

In addition to modules, there are also standalone files and scripts. 
A standalone file typically contains a single module definition or 
a collection of functions and variables that are not part of a module. 

A script is a file that contains a sequence of Julia commands intended 
to be executed together, often for data analysis or visualization.
